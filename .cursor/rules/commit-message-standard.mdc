# Commit Message Standard

Use Conventional Commits and this structure:

1. Subject line:
- Format: `<type>: <summary>`
- Types: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`, `ci`
- Max length: 50 characters
- Imperative mood, no trailing period

2. Blank line

3. Body:
- Explain why and impact, not only what changed
- Wrap each line at 72 characters max

4. Blank line

5. AI disclosure footer (required):
- `AI-Tool: Cursor`
- `AI-Model: <model name used>`
- `AI-Mode: <Agent|Plan|Ask|Debug>`

6. Co-author trailer (required for AI-assisted commits):
- Add a valid Git trailer in this exact format:
- `Co-authored-by: Cursor <cursor@cursor.com>`

Example:
`ci: add release workflow`

`Build and publish binaries on version tags to make releases`
`repeatable and reduce manual packaging errors.`

`AI-Tool: Cursor`
`AI-Model: GPT-5.3-Codex`
`AI-Mode: Agent`
`Co-authored-by: Cursor <cursor@cursor.com>`
