# Git Workflow Guardrails

Follow this workflow for all Git operations:

1. Keep `main` current before starting work:
- Switch to `main`
- Run `git pull --rebase`
- Ensure local `main` is up to date before branching

2. Always develop on a dedicated branch:
- Never implement requested work directly on `main`
- Create a branch for each targeted change before coding

3. Ensure commits are signed:
- Use signed commits for every commit (`git commit -S`)
- If signing is not configured or fails, stop and ask the user
  before proceeding with commits
